# Math-Function-Grapher
A Python project for visualizing mathematical functions using NumPy and Matplotlib and other  libraries. Includes classic examples like the Weierstrass function, with extendable code to plot any user-defined function for better mathematical intuition and analysis.
# Features
1.Plot the Weierstrass function (fractal-like, continuous but nowhere differentiable).
Extendable: just replace the function definition to graph any function you like.
Uses simple, readable Python code.
Grid-enabled plots for better visualization.


2. Plot Riemann Function - Shows how to generate and plot the classic Riemann function, highlighting its continuous yet almost nowhere differentiable behavior."
# Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the dependencies:
pip install numpy matplotlib
